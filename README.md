# ts-REST-api-for-mongodb
A type script REST API with mongodb as the data store

This is a very simple REST API written in Typescript to use express to provide access to a config file driven MongoDB back end
- the API is invoked through src/index.ts, and the rest of the functionality is done through the subdirectories in the src directory.
